# Angular-Slickgrid - Client Demos
## All demos are made with Angular-CLI
###
If you use Visual Studio Code, you can also run each of the demo through the multiple VSCode Tasks.

## Bootstrap 3 
### Install and Start Demo
Common Bootstrap 3 demo using `ngx-translate` that allows for using multiple languages (locales) and switch them on the fly.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghiscoding/angular-slickgrid-demos
cd bootstrap3-demo
npm install # OR yarn install
npm start # OR yarn start
```

### Build Demo
```bash
npm run build # OR yarn run build
```

## Bootstrap 3 - with Custom Locales
### Install and Start Demo
This is the same as the Bootstrap 3 demo except that it uses custom Locales and does not require (neither use) `ngx-translate` and are with fixed Locales (meaning you cannot switch language on the fly). The Locales that were added for the demo (English/French), can be found under `src/app/locales`. You can use and define your own custom Locales via TypeScript file.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghiscoding/angular-slickgrid-demos
cd bootstrap3-demo-with-locales
npm install # OR yarn install
npm start # OR yarn start
```

### Build Demo
```bash
npm run build # OR yarn run build
```

## Bootstrap 4
